If credentials were pushed to a remote repository like Github, the following steps can be used to removed those credentials from the commit history after they have been removed from the current commit: 


1. First the pushed credentials must be discarded and replaced with new ones and any components that use should be upgraded accordingly, anybody affected must be notified right away.

2. This next step outlines how to remove the credentials from the commit history: 

a. Checkout a new branch with a clean/empty history:

```
git checkout --orphan latest_branch
```
b. Add all the files

```
git add -A
```
c. Commit the changes

```
git commit -am "commit message"
```
d. Delete the branch

```
git branch -D main
```
e. Rename the current branch to main

```
git branch -m main
```
f. Finally, force update your repository

```
git push -f origin main
```
3. If credentials were pushed using branches other than the main branch, do the following:

a. Delete the branch remotely:  
	
```
git push -d <remote_name_aka_ssh_or_https_link> <branchname>
```
b. Delete branch locally from a different branch or main branch: 

```
git branch -d <branchname>
```
	If  the old branch is recreated using `git checkout -b <branchname>` and pushed using `git push`, it will not have any previous commit history that contained the credentials.
